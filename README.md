# Flutter Netflix Responsive UI Project

A responsive UI that can interchange between mobile and web mode. Switching between screens on the bottom navigation bar will save the content current list (as in, it will not rerender when switching between screens). In web mode, the video player preview is initiated and can be muted/unmuted. The app is responsive and will show mobile vs web layout dependent on screen size.
